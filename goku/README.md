Welcome, brave adventurer, to the realm of ultimate keyboard customization! This repository is your portal to a world where your keyboard bends to your will, powered by the mighty Goku!

## What is Goku, you ask? ü§î

Goku is a powerful tool that allows you to remap your keyboard keys and create complex macros using a simple and expressive configuration file. Think of it as giving your keyboard superpowers! üí™

## Getting Started

Ready to embark on this exciting journey? Follow these simple steps:

1.  **Configure Goku:**
    -   Edit the `karabiner.edn` file to define your custom key mappings. Check the links below for documentation and inspiration.

2.  **Update your Karabiner config:**

    To update the config file, run:

    ```bash
    GOKU_EDN_CONFIG_FILE=/Users/tpinto/setup-station/goku/karabiner.edn goku
    ```

3.  **Watch for changes (like a hawk! ü¶Ö):**

    To run a watch command, so the configuration updates automatically:

    ```bash
    GOKU_EDN_CONFIG_FILE=/Users/tpinto/setup-station/goku/karabiner.edn gokuw
    ```

    This command will monitor your `karabiner.edn` file for changes and automatically update your Karabiner configuration whenever you save. It's like having a keyboard sensei constantly guiding your keystrokes.
